The database directory is intended to contain database migrations, seeders, and factories. Since you have requested the contents of the directory itself, it is typically structured with subdirectories for these components. However, if you are looking for a specific file within the database directory, please specify.

For now, I will provide the contents of the database directory as a comment indicating that it is intentionally left blank, as it usually contains multiple files and subdirectories.

database:
