The /my-laravel-project/my-laravel-project/public directory is intended to contain the front-facing files of the application. Typically, this directory includes an index.php file that serves as the entry point for the application. 

Here are the contents for the index.php file in the public directory:

<?php

require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

$app = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';

$kernel = $app->make(Illuminate\Contracts\Http\Kernel::class);

$response = $kernel->handle(
    $request = Illuminate\Http\Request::capture()
);

$response->send();

$kernel->terminate($request, $response);
